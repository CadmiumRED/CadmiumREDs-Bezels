All bezels here are to work with the DUIMON Mega Bezel shaders, however the Game Boy and Game Boy Color bezels are the only ones that don't, just use regular shaders for those (use LCD Grid V2 GBC Color MotionBlur for good results).

Bear in mind with the About section, these bezels are designed to be used for 1440p setups.  I don't have much know-how on how to make these work in lower/higher resolutions.
