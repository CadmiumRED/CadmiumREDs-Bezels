All bezels here are to work with the DUIMON Mega Bezel shaders, however the Game Boy and Game Boy Color bezels are the only ones that don't, just use regular shaders for those (use Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light, Game Boy Color Dot Matrix, or LCD Grid V2 GBC Color MotionBlur for good results).

Bear in mind with the About section, these bezels are designed to be used for 1440p setups.  I don't have much know-how on how to make these work in lower/higher resolutions.  I do have config files made for 1440p and 1080p users for the Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Color bezels however.

Download the config file meant for your monitor setup and place it under the core folder of choice (in this case I use Gambatte [retroarch\config\Gambatte]), but be sure to remove the "-####p" part of the .CFG's file name.
